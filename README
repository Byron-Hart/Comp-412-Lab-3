Directions for building and invoking:
Since the program is in Python, it does not need to be built, just run.
Thus, executing schedule simply calls python to run Lab3.py with the command line arguments sent to schedule.

Command Line Options for schedule:
-h: Prints a list of valid command line arguments with descriptions of the function of each option.
<name>, where <name> is a valid filepath: If <name> leads to valid ILOC, the scheduler will print reordered ILOC code to standard output.
